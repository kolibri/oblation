$ ./do.sh meet # create a new meeting file
./dev-meetings/2022-07-08.md

$ subl  `./do.sh meet` # to directly open the file in editor

````

Do not forget to commit and push o_O 	


## Let's pick someone

```bash

$ vi members.txt # Place all possible entries in this file, one per line

$ ./do.sh sacrifice
